# DNT Forget -- An event reminder app

### Linting

Python files are linted with `pylint` and formatted with `Black`. Javascript files are linted with `ESLint` using Airbnb rules.

#### Files excluded

`setupTests.js`, `reportWebVitals.js`, `index.js`

These three files are included with `Create React app`, and so linting these is not required. If they are modified, they will need to be linted.

#### Excluded Rules

ESLint:
`react/no-array-index-key`, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, `react/jsx-filename-extension`, 

Standard exclusions.

`react/jsx-no-constructed-context-values`, `react/jsx-no-useless-fragment`, `react/no-children-prop`, `no-nested-ternary`, `array-callback-return`

These rules directly contradict the logic of some of our components. We would have to redesign entire portions of our app to satisfy some styling and minor optimizations.

`no-extend-native`, `react/no-this-in-sfc`

Unfortunately, we need to extend a prototype in our project.


pylint:
`E1101` no-member, `C0413` wrong-import-position, `W1508` invalid-envvar-default, `R0903`, `W0603` global-statement

Standard exclusions.

`C0200` enumerate : At times, we intend to use `range(len(` instead of `enumerate`
`C0103` invalid-name : We use ALLCAPS to represent constants. This rule does not respect that.
